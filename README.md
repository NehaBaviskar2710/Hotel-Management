# Hotel-Management
The Hotel Management System using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC is a web-based application designed to manage hotel operations, including room bookings, guest management, and check-ins/check-outs. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on hotel data such as room details, guest information, and bookings.
